# `data/forecast.json` — the daily file

This is the **only** file the morning job rewrites. The page (`index.html`, `app.js`, `style.css`) and the
beach guide (`data/beaches.json`) stay as they are. The page scores every beach from this file, so it needs
numbers, not prose.

Easiest path: `python3 scripts/update_forecast.py && python3 scripts/validate.py` (fetches everything below
and writes the file). If you fill it by hand or from other sources, follow this spec exactly.

All times are **local Pacific/Auckland wall-clock time**, `"HH:MM"` 24-hour (e.g. `"07:00"`, `"19:17"`).
Units are in the field names: `Kn` knots, `M` metres, `S` seconds, `Deg` degrees true, `C` °C, `Mm` mm, `Pct` %.

## Top level

| field | type | required | meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `schemaVersion` | number | yes | always `1` |
| `updated` | string | yes | ISO 8601 **with offset**, when this file was made, e.g. `"2026-10-09T07:19:00+13:00"` (NZDT +13, NZST +12) |
| `timezone` | string | yes | always `"Pacific/Auckland"` |
| `location` | object | no | `{ "name": "Snells Beach", "lat": -36.42, "lon": 174.73 }` (info only) |
| `sources` | array | yes | non-empty; each `{ "what": "Wind & weather", "name": "met.no Locationforecast", "url": "https://…", "issued": "<ISO time, optional>" }`. Shown in the footer. |
| `days` | array | yes | consecutive dates, **today first**, normally 4 days (today + 3) |

## `days[]`

| field | type | required | meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `date` | `"YYYY-MM-DD"` | yes | local date |
| `sunrise`, `sunset` | `"HH:MM"` | yes | local times; slots outside daylight are ignored for picks |
| `airMaxC` | number | no | daily max air temp °C |
| `waterTempC` | number | no | sea surface temp °C (daytime mean, Kawau Bay) |
| `tides` | array | yes | every high/low turn that day **in time order, alternating**: `{ "time": "06:59", "type": "high", "heightM": 2.7 }`. Mahurangi Harbour. At least 2. |
| `slots` | array | yes | weather **every hour** `06:00`–`20:00`, in time order (at least 2, at least one in daylight). The page scores each hour, so hourly data gives the best windows and the now-vs-later timeline. |
| `swell` | array | yes | sea state at `06:00, 09:00, 12:00, 15:00, 18:00` (at least 1). The nearest entry to each slot is used. |
| `traffic` | object | no | `{ "level": "light" \| "moderate" \| "busy", "note": "short text" }`. Put it on Saturdays, Sundays and public holidays (Labour Day = 4th Monday of October). Its presence turns on the Matakana chip and a small score penalty for beaches through Matakana; weekends get the chip even without it. It is a heuristic note, not live traffic. |

### `slots[]`

| field | type | required | meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `time` | `"HH:MM"` | yes | local |
| `windDirDeg` | number 0–360 | yes | direction the wind blows **from**, degrees true (90 = easterly). Use the blend below, not a single model hour. |
| `windKn` | number | yes | mean wind speed, knots (met.no gives m/s: × 1.94384) |
| `gustKn` | number | no | gust, knots (≥ `windKn`) |
| `rainMm` | number | no | rain in the hour, mm (mean of met.no and Open-Meteo where both exist) |
| `rainProbPct` | number 0–100 | no, strongly recommended | chance of rain that hour, % (Open-Meteo `precipitation_probability`). Drives rain scoring and the rain chip; without it the page falls back to `rainMm`/`sky` and validate.py warns. |
| `airC` | number | no | air temp °C |
| `cloudPct` | number 0–100 | no | cloud cover |
| `sky` | string | no | one of `sun`, `partly`, `cloud`, `fog`, `showers`, `rain`, `storm` (drives the icon and a small rain penalty) |
| `src` | string | no | which models went in, e.g. `"metno+openmeteo"` (info only) |
| `models` | object | no | raw per-model wind for checking, `{ "metno": [dirDeg, kn], "openmeteo": [dirDeg, kn] }` (info only) |

**Wind blend (how `update_forecast.py` makes `windDirDeg`/`windKn`).** One model hour in light air can point
anywhere (on Sat 10 Oct 2026 met.no's 7am value was 345°/NNW while every other hour and model said N–NNE).
So each slot is: met.no averaged as vectors over h-1, h, h+1 (while met.no is hourly; its 6-hourly steps later in
the run are used only at their exact hour), then vector-averaged with Open-Meteo's hour h at equal weight.
Speed is the plain mean of the two. The page shows winds under 5 kn as "light", with no direction.

### `swell[]`

| field | type | required | meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `time` | `"HH:MM"` | yes | local |
| `open.swellM` | number | yes | swell height off Te Ārai (open coast), metres. Drives surf scores. |
| `open.periodS` | number | yes | swell period, seconds |
| `open.dirDeg` | number | yes | direction swell comes **from**, degrees true (45 = NE) |
| `open.waveM` | number | no | total significant wave height off Te Ārai, metres (flatness at open beaches) |
| `inner.waveM` | number | yes | total significant wave height in Kawau Bay, metres (flatness at the inner bays) |
| `inner.periodS`, `inner.dirDeg` | number | no | as above, Kawau Bay |

Open-Meteo Marine grid points used: inner `-36.42, 174.80` (snaps to -36.458, 174.875) and open `-36.13, 174.85`
(snaps to -36.125, 174.875), `cell_selection=sea`, hourly `swell_wave_height, swell_wave_period,
swell_wave_direction, wave_height, wave_period, wave_direction, sea_surface_temperature`.

## Rules of thumb

- Never invent numbers. If a source is down, use another real one (MetService marine, Open-Meteo forecast) and name it in `sources`.
- Keep `updated` honest; the page warns if it is more than 30 hours old.
- After writing: `python3 scripts/validate.py` must print `OK`. Exit code 1 means fix and re-run.

# `data/beaches.json` — the standing guide (rarely edited)

Per beach: `id`, `name`, `area`, `lat`/`lon`, `driveMin`/`driveKm` (OSRM from Snells Beach township),
`viaMatakana`, `facingDeg` (direction the beach looks out to sea; wind from there is onshore, from the opposite side
offshore), `shelteredFrom` (8-point wind directions that the local knowledge says are sheltered, e.g. `["SE"]`),
`tide` (`{"mode":"high",…}` = tide-limited: the page treats it as swimmable from mid-tide rising to mid-tide falling,
i.e. halfway in time between each low and the high; `hours` is kept for reference only. `{"mode":"all"}` = any tide), `exposure`
(`{"source":"inner"|"open","factor":0–1}` scales the Kawau Bay or Te Ārai wave height to this beach),
`highTideSand` (`plenty` | `some` | `little`: dry sand left at high tide, a local estimate used by hangout mode),
`suits` (0–1 per activity: `swim`, `surf`, `snorkel`, `sup`, `hangout`), `notes` (short bullets), optional `doc` (Goat Island DOC limits), and `dog`:
`{verified, checked, source, rules:[{from:"MM-DD", to:"MM-DD", status, chip, text}, …, {status, chip, text}]}`.
Dog rules are matched in order by date (ranges may wrap the new year); the last rule has no dates and is the
catch-all. `status` is `offlead` | `leash` | `limited` (time-restricted) | `banned`. A beach whose rule is not
verified should have `"verified": false` and the page shows "unverified, check signs".
